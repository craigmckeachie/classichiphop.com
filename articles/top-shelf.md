# Top Shelf 1988

I was excited to find out there was an album released with lost recordings of many of my favorite rappers from 1988.
Listening to "Top Shelf 1988" had me feeling so nostalgic and happy. It was in heavy rotation for weeks.
In particular, Big Daddy Kane's song felt like Rick Rubin had created the beat around the same time as Licensed to Ill.
And I swore Kane's voice sounded like it did on "Long Live the Kane" and "It's a Big Daddy thing". I was wrong.
But I don't care. Thank you Rostrum Records.
Like a kid who likes to watch a scary movie because of how it makes them feel even if it's pretend. I loved it.

The beats are so golden era hip hop. It feels like it's 88 time to set 'em straight.
Biz sounds like he is still on the Cold Chillin label.
The Craig G beat sounds like it could be on his Kingpin album or Marly Marl in Control.
Special Ed flows like "Think About It".
MC Lyte sounds like she is flowing over a King of Chill beat...you get the idea.

If you are a fan of golden age hip hop please go stream the album immediately.

The story is of how the recordings were lost goes as follows.
A studio named Top Shelf was a popular recording destination for rap artists in the late 80s.
The studio was looted during the Tompkins Square Park riots and all these recordings were taken.
The recordings were found years later and are now being released.

But it is not true.
And again, I don't care.
Honestly the truth isn't far off.
The recordings were done in the 90s by an upstart label Rostrum Records whose founders had a true love for hip hop and recorded artists over the beats they had made which mimicked the sound of the period.
Rostrum Records couldn't get anyone to distribute the album in the 90s but ended up finding success with Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller.
Years later the recordings have been released with a clever publicity campaign about the lost recordings.

Go stream it now by searching for "Top Shelf 1988" on your favorite streaming platform.
