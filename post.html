          <h1>Unreleased Material from Hip Hop Legends</h1>
          <p>
            I was excited to find out there was an album released with lost
            recordings of many of my favorite rappers from 1988. Listening to
            <a target="_blank" href="https://topshelf1988.com/"
              >"Top Shelf 1988"</a
            >
            had me feeling so nostalgic and happy. It was in heavy rotation for
            weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              In particular, Big Daddy Kane's song felt like Rick Rubin had
              created the beat. And I swore Kane's voice sounded like it did on
              "Long Live the Kane" and "It's a Big Daddy thing" before his voice
              deepened.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I was wrong. But I don't care. Thank you Rostrum Records. Like a kid
            who likes to watch a scary movie because of how it makes them feel
            even if it's pretend. I loved it.
          </p>

          <h2>The Beats Were Dope, The Sound Was On</h2>
          <p>
            The beats are so golden era hip hop. It feels as if "it's 88, time
            to set 'em straight".
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Biz is indistinguishable from his Cold Chillin heyday.</li>
            <li>
              The Craig G beat could be on his "Kingpin" album or "Marley Marl's
              In Control".
            </li>
            <li>Special Ed's flow is reminiscent of "Think About It".</li>
            <li>
              MC Lyte sounds like she is flowing over a King of Chill beat...you
              get the idea.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Lost Tapes</h2>
          <p>The story of how the recordings were lost goes as follows:</p>
          <p>
            A studio named Top Shelf was a popular recording destination for rap
            artists in the late 80s. The studio was looted during the Tompkins
            Square Park riots and all these recordings were taken. The
            recordings were found years later and are now being released.
          </p>

          <h2>The Truth</h2>
          <p>
            But the story is not true. And again, I don't care. Honestly the
            truth isn't far off.
          </p>
          <p>
            The recordings were done in the 90s by an upstart label
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostrum_Records"
              >Rostrum Records</a
            >
            whose founders had a true love for hip hop and recorded artists over
            the beats they had made which mimicked the sound of the period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rostrum Records couldn't get anyone to distribute the album in the
            90s but ended up finding success with Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller.
            Years later the recordings have been released with a clever
            publicity campaign about the lost recordings.
          </p>
